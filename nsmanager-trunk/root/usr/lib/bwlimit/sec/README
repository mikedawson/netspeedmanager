SEC (Simple Event Correlator) 2.5.3

Introduction:
-------------
SEC is a simple event correlation tool that reads lines from files, named
pipes, or standard input, and matches the lines with regular expressions, 
Perl subroutines, and other patterns for recognizing input events. 
Events are then correlated according to the rules in configuration files,
producing output events by executing user-specified shell commands, by 
writing messages to pipes or files, etc.

Release Notes:
--------------
SEC has been tested primarily on Linux and Solaris, but since it is written 
in perl and does not use any platform dependent subroutines, it should also
work on other OS platforms.
Since SEC employs the perl qr// operator that was introduced in perl 5.005, 
perl 5.005 or higher is required for running SEC. Because SEC is generally 
not tested against outdated perl releases, it is recommended to run SEC 
with at least perl 5.6 (see http://www.perl.org for the latest stable perl 
release). 
SEC also uses perl Getopt, POSIX, Fcntl, IO::Handle, and Sys::Syslog modules, 
but those modules are included in the standard installation of perl.
